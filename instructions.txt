'AUTO' INSTRUCTIONS
You can place comments in between '>' characters. 
You can place a # in front of a command to blank it out.

Here are the commands for this application:

pause - pauses the app asking for user input
run filepath args - runs an application at a specific location i.e - "run C:\hello.exe argument1 argument2 argument3"
deletefile filepath - deletes a file at a location i.e - "deletefile C:\hello.exe"
copyfile sourcepath destinationpath - copies a file to a new location i.e - "copyfile C:\hello.exe C:\newhello.exe"
clearfolder sourcepath - clears a folder of all files in it i.e - "clearfolder C:\folder"
copyfolder sourcepath destinationpath - copies all files in a folder to new location i.e "copyfolder C:\folder C:\newfolder"

You can start a loop for so many iterations with a colon i.e - ":loop 2" (loop twice)
You can return to the loop with a goto i.e "goto :loop"

Every time you run this, a log will be generated in a folder 'autologs' where the application is saved.
